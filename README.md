# Tableau-Project
This repository contains the Auction Ready Dashboard, built using Tableau. The project analyzes player data to help teams make informed auction decisions. It evaluates batsmen (runs), bowlers (wickets), all-rounders (bat/bowl averages), wicketkeepers (catches/stumpings), captains (experience), and impact players (strike rate/economy).
