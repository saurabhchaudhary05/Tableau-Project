🌟 Project Completed: Auction Ready Dashboard 🎯

I'm thrilled to share the completion of my latest Tableau project, where I designed an interactive and data-driven dashboard titled "Auction Ready: Top Players Teams Must Target."

This dashboard is a one-stop solution for teams preparing for auctions, helping them identify and target the right players to build a winning squad. It dives deep into player analytics and provides insights to create a well-balanced and impactful team combination.

🔑 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:
📊 Batsmen: Evaluated based on runs scored to identify consistent and impactful performers.
🎯 Bowlers: Analyzed on the basis of wickets taken, ensuring teams can target strike bowlers.
💪 All-Rounders: Considered both batting average and bowling average for finding game-changers who contribute in multiple ways.
🧤 Wicketkeepers: Assessed using metrics like catches and stumpings to ensure sharpness behind the stumps.
👨‍✈️ Captains: Focused on the number of matches played to gauge leadership experience and strategic capabilities.
⚡ Impact Players: Rated using batting strike rate and bowling economy to identify individuals who can turn games around.

🌟 What Makes This Dashboard Unique?
The interactive nature of the dashboard allows teams to explore different scenarios and customize player selection based on their strategies. It’s designed to help teams make data-backed decisions during the auction process, minimizing guesswork and maximizing the chances of success.

This project was a great learning experience, enhancing my skills in data visualization, analytical storytelling, and sports performance analytics. By combining data with visualization techniques, I aimed to create a tool that’s not just informative but also actionable for teams looking to win big.
